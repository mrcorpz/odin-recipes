    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Malaysian satay is just like Thai or Indonesian ones but there is a difference in taste. Give it a try. No need to barbeque, just grill them in your oven. Serve with Malaysian satay sauce.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 large onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 1-inch shrimp paste(belacan)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon galangal powder(lengkuas)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground anise seed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
        <li>60 bamboo skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken cubes in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Place onions, brown sugar, garlic, shrimp paste, galangal powder, coriander, cumin, anise seed, black pepper, and turmeric in the bowl of a food processor. <br>Grind into a smooth paste. Transfer to bowl with chicken; mix well to coat chicken.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Thread chicken onto bamboo skewers, leaving enough space to hold skewers. Arrange skewers on baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until top is browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven; flip all the skewers over. Return to the oven and broil second side until browned, about 10 minutes more. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
